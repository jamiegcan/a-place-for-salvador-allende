## The democratic path towards socialism

_Salvador Allende headed the project which sought to establish socialism through democratic means. His government program envisioned the construction of a people's State and a state-planned economy, which would end with the coup d'État in 1973._

Salvador Allende was the president who attempted to establish socialism in Chile through democratic means.

He was born in 1908 to an upper-middle class family from Valparaíso. He has shown his vocation towards public service since his student years in the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Chile. He joined the university political group "Avance" in 1929 and at 25 years old, Allende became the first regional secretary of the Socialist Party of Chile when it was founded in 1933.

Physician, socialist and Freemason: Allende possessed the characteristic profile of a Chilean progressive and secular politician during the first half of the 20th century. He graduated with a medical degree and has dedicated himself to social medicine since the start of his career, publishing various works about public health, such as _La realidad médico social chilena_ (_The Chilean medico-social reality_). He joined the Freemasonry at a very young age and was part of the famous Grand Lodge of Chile.

He was elected member of the Chilean Chamber of Deputies for Valparaíso and Quillota before turning 30 years old. He actively participated in the foundation of the Frente Popular (Popular Front coalition) and was appointed Minister of Health, Pensions and Social Assistance in the government of President Pedro Aguirre Cerda. In 1945, he was elected senator and remained in this position until 1970. He ran for the Presidency of the Republic of Chile four times—1952, 1958, 1964 and 1970—representing an alliance with a socialist and communist base.

Allende only won the presidency in his last candidacy in 1970, and he entered the La Moneda presidential palace with support from a coalition of leftist parties, the Unidad Popular (Popular Unity). In these elections, Salvador Allende obtained the most number of votes at 36%, followed by Jorge Alessandri with 34.9% of votes. Since neither of them won an absolute majority of the votes, the Chilean Congress had to ratify the winner of the elections with a run-off vote. In the same year on 24 October, "Salvador Allende was elected President by the Congress with 153 votes against 35 for Alessandri" (_Fermandois, Joaquín. La Revolución inconclusa, CEP, 2013, p.252_).

For the first time in history, and causing expectation around the world, a Socialist and Marxist politician became head of state through direct elections. Salvador Allende's government then began a difficult and unique experience: carrying the country through the democratic path towards socialism. Allende, along with an important group of his followers, were convinced that socialism could be constructed under the basis of Chilean democratic traditions. In this sense, it is siginficant to note that one of the few laws approved by the whole Congress was the nationalization of major copper mines in Chile.

Nevertheless, the radical nature of Allende's government program faced fierce opposition within and outside of his country. In the middle of a political context still dominated by the Cold War, the United States government decided to use all means necessary to achieve their ultimate goal of overthrowing the Chilean government.

During 1972, various industry groups paralized their activities; among these were the mass railway and transportation industries. Shortage of basic goods and persistent rumors of a military coup contributed in creating a collective feeling of misrule among the public.

On 11 September 1973, the Popular Unity government was overthrown by a coup d'État headed by General Augusto Pinochet. A Military Junta was formed and released a first communication requesting President Allende to immediately hand over his powers to the Chilean Armed Forces and Police. Allende resisted along with his most loyal collaborators in the La Moneda palace and warned his loved ones that he would die where the people had put him in place: as President of Chile. He delivered his last words before the bombing of the presidential palace, and at 2 p.m., before the military entered the palace, Salvador Allende died by suicide.
